Roar of the jungle dragon from the terraria calamity mod soundtrack starts playing
2030, 6 years after rosbptmga Leo gets bored again and decides to merge new mexico with mexico to form ULTIMATE MEXICO. Along with him, Ben, Noah, and occasionally Ben’s brother join him in the ultimate quest to make it so the United States only has 49 states. Will he succeed? Who am I kidding? It's a random Ohio script spinoff, of course he’s gonna succeed.
