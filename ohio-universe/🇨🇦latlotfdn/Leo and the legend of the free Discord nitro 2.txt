“Hardware store” by weird al starts
One day on a snowy winter day or something I have no idea, 3 years after rosbptmga, Leo is in a discord call with his friends, he realizes he can't stream in hd because he doesn't have discord nitro! This bothers Leo because he wants to share his first playthrough of chapter 6! Leo tells his friends to meet at an undisclosed location in Colorado because “it's easy to get there.” 
[Leo]:"hi guys”
[Ben]:"what”
[Noah]:"hai”
[Leo]:"we need to get free discord nitro!”
[Noah]:"real”
[Ben]:"where is this,"free discord nitro” at”
[Leo]:"Calgary, Canada”
[Ben]:"then why are we in colorado”
[Leo]:"because it's easy for all of us to get here”
[Ben]:"Why didn't you just go by yourself?”
[Leo]:"because i don't have a driver’s license”
[Ben]:"oh. Wait, can't you just teleport?”
[Leo]:"no not anymore, our world runs on source 2 and not goldsource now”
[Ben]:"the hell is source 2”
[Leo]:"it's the source physics engine but better”
[Ben]:"dude this script isn't gonna be any fun because we don't have to overcome anything”
[Leo]:"bro forgot we are 3 large states away from our destination”
[Ben]:"oh yeah”
[Leo]:"okay we need a game plan”
[Ben]:"sure”
[Leo]:"i think we should first get a car that ben can drive because noah here has failed his driving test multiple times, then we should go to somewhere in wyoming, then idaho to stock up on food (potatoes), then we arrive at montana cross the border, go to calgary then get ourselves the free discord nitro!”
[Noah]:"great plan broskie”
[Leo]:"please shut up noah”
[Noah]:"i guess i will”
[Leo]:"thank you”
[Noah]:"your welcome”
[Ben]:"okay let's get going to a car dealership”
[Leo]:'Wait ben, how much money do you have?’
[Ben]:"bro what do you mean we are all millionaires after the ohio invasion, everyone showered us with money and praise for removing the ohioans”
[Leo]:"oh yeah i forgot about that
[Ben]:”how do you forget your a millionaire”
[Leo]:”i just do”
[Ben]:”Wait, why are we trying to get free discord nitro if we are millionaires?”
[Leo]:”the adventure”
[Noah]:"let's get going”

[Ben]:"yes i will buy this car”
[Cashier]:"Thank you for the purchase of the car!”
[Ben]:"your welcome”
[Leo]:"kay lets go now”
