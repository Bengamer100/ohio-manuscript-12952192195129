Albuquerque by weird al starts playing because why not
July 4th, 1776 In an alternate universe where the disney movie “teacher’s pet” will never be made, the declaration of independence is signed, declaring the independence of america, the founding fathers or whatever make version one of what will soon be called “the america core” that stores the knowledge of all the americans alive, jump to the year 1803 on march first, when ohio became an american state, the people of ohio decided to make an ohioan generator in the newly made “ohio core” just incase a catastrophic event happens sometime in the future. Cut to 1 year before rosbptmga or like 4 years after if you want to be accurate, where ben’s brother is a bit bored of existing without anything happening, and decides to sabotage the ohio core just because it's funny
[Ben’s brother]:”I'm bored”
