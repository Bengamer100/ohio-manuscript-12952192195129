Jazz music starts 
It was a swell day in the United States until the residents heard the news. Ohio is attacking the United states! A day or so later, aaaaaaaaaaa[alarm]aaaaaaaaaa. The Ohians attacked Illinois, Texas, and Organ! Why those states, It's for the plot okay? Three random people, who happened to be friends online, went to Florida, for no reason but for plot. The three people for the plot, Leo, Ben, and Noah. They found each other for the plot. [Leo]:”Ello” 
[Noah]:"Hi”
[Ben]:”Hello.”
[Leo]:"seen that Ohio invasion going on?”
[Ben and Noah]:"Yeah.”
[Leo]:”we need to end it as fast as possible, they have already attacked our home states.” 
[Ben]:”Yup” 
[Leo]:”We need to find shelter, I think that there is a bunker a few minutes from here for plot convenience”
[Ben]:"yeah there is one.”
[Noah]:”Ok what do we do?”
[Leo and Ben]:”get to the bunker, stupid”
[Noah]:"ok” 
They walk to the bunker 
[Leo]:”Here we are” 
[Ben]:"We need to get supplies” 
[Noah]:"Ya” 
[Leo]:”me and Ben will go out and find some to work with”
[Ben]:”Yeah” 
Leo and Ben go out to find supplies while Noah tries to find a good room to stay in for the plot 
[Leo]:”found some screws” 
[Ben]:”Yeah me too” 
[Leo]:"found some pallets” 
[Ben]:"alright, let’s go back to the bunker” 
Leo and Ben go back to the bunker 
[Leo]:”We are back” 
[Noah]:”Hi” 
[Ben]:”alright we need to make weapons”
[Noah]:”Ya” 
[Leo]:”Ja” 
[Leo]:”Okay let's do it” 
Leo, Noah, and Ben proceed to make weapons out of sticks and nails, and maybe a knife or three 
[Ben]:”That should do” 
[Leo]:”but i only have a knife taped to a crowbar while Noah has a gun” 
[Ben]:”Tough luck man” 
[Leo]:”I’m gonna sleep”
[Ben and Noah]:”Yeah I am too” 
Leo, Ben, and Noah proceed to sleep 
eight hours later…
[Leo]:”I’m hungry…” 
[Leo]:”We should find food” 
[Ben]:”Yeah” 
(this next portion was made in 4th grade, yes, all of it) Ben and Leo go out to get food in the harsh florida weather conditions because we are not native to florida 
[Leo]:” I found something” 
[Ben]:”what did you find?”
[Leo]:”Like 4 coconuts”
[Ben]:"Nice, I found some wood and a fish”
[Leo]:” I guess we can make fire now but that is useless if we can’t make a fire”
[Ben]:” Yeah we could make a fire or we could use 2D shapes and filter out which ones to use and then get the normal height of each and one of the shapes and then get the square root of all of them to use it as the perimeter of the parallelogram so we can make a device that will send us to france so we can get a croissant so we can boat to canada so we can freeze the Ohioans with freeze rays we got from mexico that only work in canada.”
[Noah]:”That sounds complicated”
[Leo and Ben at the same time]:"A”
[Leo]:”How did you get here” 
[Noah]:”did you not see me come here?”
[Ben]:”Nope”
[Leo]:”Why would we?”
[Noah]:”Because you don’t want to be eaten by the Ohio people”
[Leo]:”I mean yeah”
[Ben]:”Alright let us go back” 
[Leo]:"Good idea bruv”
Noah Leo and Ben walk back to the bunker 
[Leo]:”my legs hurt”
[Ben]:”Of course they do, your a couch potato”
[Leo]:”Hey! I am not a couch potato”
[Ben]:” yes you are”
[Noah]:”I agree with Ben”
[Leo]:"At least we got some food”
[Tv]:"BREAKING NEWS! The Ohioans are attacking Florida, and they are mad! More news tomorrow at 9. Anyways, beans are buy one get none free today at target, walmart, and schnucks.”
[Leo]:”I think we need to evacuate now”
[Ben]:”I agree with Leo for the first time in Ever” 
[Leo]:”Thanks” 
[Noah]:” i guess too, also i found sheeps”
[Leo]:”S H E E P.” 
[Noah]:”eh”
[Leo]:”Noah stop melting my brain with your grammar that is as bad as a sheep that just got hit on the head 50 times with a 100 pound chunk of metal’s grammar.
[Noah]:”nah, i dont feel like it”
c r e e k k 
[Leo]:”I heard something” 
[Noah]:”so did i”
[Ben]:”I did too” 
[Leo]:”we should check it out” 
[Ben]:"Nah, it was probably our 35.75 in. W 26.5 cu. ft. 3-Door Family Hub French Door Smart Refrigerator in Fingerprint Resistant Stainless Steel thingy”
[Leo]:”We should still check it out”
[Ben]:”I disagree with Leo” 
[Noah]:”ya” 
[Ben]:”What happened to those sheep?”
[Noah]:”they left”
[Ben]:”oh okay”
[Leo]:”fine then I’m going myself then.”
Leo goes up to the bunker door and opens it a little bit 
[Ohioan]:”ughg hughughugu”
[Leo]:”Ew”
Leo goes back to Ben and Noah 
[Leo]:”It was a Ohioan”
[Ben]:” we could calculate the-”
[Leo]:”hush.” 
[Ben]:”No, we could calculate the circumference of a pie (not to be confused with pi) so we can paintball a trap made by the Ohioan so we could kill him instantly”
[Noah]:”That sounds too complicated still” 
The next day
[Tv]:”Brand new news, The Ohians are attacking random bunkers across the united states, if you are in one right now, you need to evacuate, because they are mad! More news at 2. On other notes, beans are buy 100000 get 1 free at all stores across the United states, even Hy-vee!” 
[Noah]:”That sounds like a good deal” 
[Leo]:”No it doesn’t Noah” 
[Ben]:”Can we focus please?”
[Leo]:”fine” 
[Ben]:”I think we need to leave soon”
[Leo]:”But how? An Ohioan is already at our door slapping it”
[Noah]:”Ben is gonna make another really complicated thing now”
[Ben]:”let's make a contraption to launch ourselves into the door at mach 2 so we can send the Ohioan into hyperspace with the recoil of us hitting the entrance”
[Leo]”how about no, lets just shank it to death”
[Noah]:”beats my idea” 
[Leo]:”What's your idea?”
[Noah]:”we run”
[Leo]:”Yeah that’s a terrible idea”
Leo, Ben, and Noah open the bunker door and violently shank the Ohioan to death 
[Leo]:”that was easy” 
[Ben]:”Yeah it was really easy to do that, my ideas are too complicated to be a thing, you still suck though Leo”
[Leo]:”darn it”
[Ben]:"Let’s just, leave now”
[Leo]:"yeah we should”
[Noah]:”can i have a-”
[Ben and Leo]:”No.” 
[Noah]:”dam”
[Ben]:”We should go though I feel we aren’t safe here”
Ben, Leo, and Noah go into the woods in South Carolina, remembering to bring everything they need because we need the plot to continue because It's important to the plot
[Leo]:”my legs hu-”
[Ben]:”we know” 
[Leo]:”Really Ben?”
[Ben]:”yes. Why do you think I bully Noah for being a furry? By the way, we should get like a fire going, cause im hungry, and we are out of beans and coconuts”
[Leo]:”ok, do we still have that wood we got in florida?”
[Ben]:”Yes”
2PM 
[Tv]:”Breaking news, the Ohioans are attacking places like North Carolina, Florida, Idaho, and Montana, More news in 10 minutes, Anyways, in other news beans are buy 1 get a tenth free”
[Noah]:”Now that is a good deal”
[Leo]:”N O I T I S N O T I T I S N O T A G O O D D E A L”
[Noah]:”Okay jeez”
[Leo]:”lets fish because i'm hungry and i'm not me when i'm hungry”
[Ben]:”good idea”
[Leo]:”thank”
hughughguhguhgug 
[Leo]:”what was that” 
[Ben]:”Ohioan”
[Leo]:”oh, lets shank it”
[Ben]:"Natural instincts, am I right?...”
[Ben]:”We need to look at it first”
[Leo]:”why?”
[Ben]:”to see how many there are before we shank them”
[Leo]:”oh good idea”
Ben and Leo observes the Ohioans there are on the thing i guess right now 
[Ben]:”five of them” 
[Leo]:”i think we can shank them, doesn’t look too hard”
[Ben]:”yeah but we need to take precautions”
[Leo]:”what does that mean”
[Ben]:”a measure taken in advance to prevent something dangerous, unpleasant, or inconvenient from happening”
[Leo]:”oh, okay”
Ben and Leo take precautions and like i don't know make a trap or something just incase they fail with the shanking attempt
[Ben]:"Wait, where is Noah? He just got dead silent?”
[Leo]:"Eh, it doesn’t matter. He’ll just appear randomly in the script.”
[Ben]:"Good enough explanation.” 
[Leo]:”alright we can shank them now, lets go”
[Ben]:”alright I guess we can do that now” 
[Leo]:”how do we do that i couldn’t see because i'm terrible at including details in stories”
[Ben]:”oh we just teleported behind them”
[Leo]:”okay”
[Ben]:”alright let's do it now, okay?”
[Leo]:”ok” 
Ben and Leo shank the Ohioans by how do i say this, where did my script go, i lost it, oh there it is, HMHM teleporting behind them with the numerous bugs in the goldsource physics engine that this world is running on 
[Leo]:”why was that so easy”
[Ben]:”because of the numerous bugs in the physics engine of earth”
[Leo]:”oh”
[Ben]:”yeah, It's weird”
[Leo]:”alright i guess that works nicely”
[Ben]:”we should see if Noah is awake yet”
[Leo]:”yeah we should”
Ben and Leo go back to the campsite 
[Ben]:”taken care of nicely” 
[Noah]:"wuh, oh It's you guys, i have an idea, we should go through north carolina, virginia, and west virginia so we can get to Ohio and destroy the core of the infection”
[Leo]:"See? I told you he’d turn up randomly!”
[Ben]:”Noah, where are we gonna get a car for that, and we are all under 15 so legally we cannot dri-”
[Noah]:”let me stop you there, we don’t need to drive legally, this is an Ohioan apocalypse we are talking about, so let’s just illegally drive through those states so we can get to Ohio, also we will get a car in the local car shop that is closed because of the Ohioans”
[Ben]:"I have never seen Noah say a full long sentence flawlessly without grammar issues and stutteri-”
[Noah]:"Just listen to the plan.”
[Leo]:”Doesn’t the proposition partake in the act of illicit activity via larceny of a motor vehicle?"
[Ben]:"Can you please stop doing stuff you can't such as sophisticatedly phrase a sentence so voluminous and comprehensi-”
[Leo]:"Can you please shut up?”
[Ben]:"... Really Leo?”
[Noah]:"Anyways, nothing is illegal if nobody sees it”
[Leo]:”eh true, let's do it Noah”
[Noah]:”ok we go get car”
[Ben]:”alright good idea” 
Ben, Leo, and Noah go to get a Land Rover Range Rover Evoque 2.0 TD4 E-Capability 4x4 HSE Dynamic i guess, that was easy to find an overly complicated car name on google, wait is this still recording me? Darn 
[Ben]:”well that was easy to get a free Land Rover Range Rover Evoque 2.0 TD4 E-Capability 4x4 HSE Dynamic”
[Leo]:”what”
[Ben]:”That's the name of the car we"Rented"."
[Leo]:”oh, alright let’s go now” 
Ben, Leo, and Noah go to North Carolina so they could get closer to Ohio cause uhhhh next script page… where is it? Oh there it is, man i hate this job, wait is this still recording again? anyways , they need to destroy the… Source? Eh, who cares. I’m resigning after this story [Leo]:”why don’t you just resign now?” AH how did you get in my studio? This studio is for narrators only! [Leo]:”Do you think I care at all?”. Yeah.[Leo]:”no i don’t, now get out of MY studio NOW!” okay i will [Leo]:” and resign now because you aren’t getting your job back” okay ): 
[Leo]:”alright now that the narrator has resigned we can finally do stuff”
[Noah]:”wut”
[Leo]:”nuthen”
[Ben]:”alright we are here”
[Leo]:”Noah doesn’t have enough dialogue, lets let him talk'' 
[Noah]:”what does that mean bruh i have no idea what that means because im dumb or whatever according to you”
[Leo]:”>:(”
[Noah]:”what? im just telling the truth, also on another note, how do i tame wolves in minecraft?”
[Leo]:”you give them bones Noah”
[Noah]:”oh okay” 
they get to North Carolina and realize that it is invaded by Ohioans, and now they have to fight them off with their knives because guns make too much noise i guess idk 
[Ben]:”i forgot that north carolina was invaded by Ohioans”
[Leo]:”owie dat hurb” 
[Ben]:”Did you get bitten?” 
[Leo]:”no he just slapped me a little hard.By the way, how is the gas Ben?”
[Ben]:”almost halfway full”
[Leo]:”i would think it would be more empty”
[Ben]:”nah time and space is messed up in this universe so the car didn’t use most of the gas”
[Leo]:”oh okay”
[Noah]:”what do you mean”
[Leo]:”don’t worry bout it now”
[Noah]:”oh ok”
[Leo]:”lets go to virginia so we can get closer to Ohio”
[Ben]:”good idea”
[Noah]:”hey that was my idea!” 
[Leo]:”no it wasn’t.”
[Noah]:”yes it was”
[Leo]:”No it wasn’t Noah”
[Noah]:”but-”
[Leo]:”no buts Noah, i looked back in the- wait it was your idea crap”
[Noah]:”told you”
[Ben]:”Let's just go, I'm getting tired of you two arguing.”
Ben, Leo, and Noah get in their car to go to virginia to get closer to Ohio to remove the source of the goldsource engine problem or something i don’t know i'm just a narrator who is paid minimum wage to narrate under Leo’s command 
[Leo]:”this is taking too long man can’t we just teleport here because of the goldsource engine bugs?”
[Ben]:”no, Noah is too small brain to know how to teleport using goldsource engine bugs”
[Noah]:”what”
[Leo]:”nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing”
[Ben]:”perfect answer”
[Leo]:”Thanks, Anyways Ben, how many more hours till we get there”

[Leo]:"how do you not know what a buc-ee’s is you croissant”
[Noah]:”good insult”
[Ben]:”ok let’s go there now”
[Leo]:”good idea Ben”
Ben, Leo, and Noah go to buc-ees or whatever It's called i dont know im not from the southern area also why does buc-ee's literally looks like the heaven of a supermarket, for some reason, look It's a truck shop store, i don't know why they invented fancy truck stop stores ok?
[Ben]:"can somebody tell me why their mascot is a beaver”
[Leo]:"No”
[Ben]:"fair point, i guess”
[Noah]:"i'm still hungry”
[Leo and Ben]:"Please delete your mouth for god's sake.”
[Ben]:"Woah, a lot of cool stuff, such as a random truck in the store for some reason.”
[Noah]:"Im hung-”
You know what? I'm just going to mute Noah for the rest of the part. Cause he is really annoying me and the rest of the recording team cause he is so annoying
[Ben]:"Welp, at least we don't have to deal with a picky eater.
[Noah]: muted screaming
[Leo]:"Eh, it was probably the wind.”
[Ben]:"I guess.”
[Noah]: muted screaming
[Ben]:"I see a food court there with food!”
[Leo]:"Cmon, lets go over there”
[Ben]:"False alarm, they can't afford to make food probably because of the Ohioans.”
[Leo]:"Let's go eat the infinite jerky supply over there”
[Noah]:"muted agreement”
Ben, Leo, and Noah proceed to gobble down the infinite supply of Jerky that keeps regenerating forever
[Leo]:”that was good jerky, let's bring some, especially the lemon peppered one, that was good”
[Noah]: muted agreement
Okay Noah has been muted too long i'm unmut- 
[Ben]:"Holdup, can I use the restroom?”
[Leo]:"Sure, just don't take too long.”
Proceeds to break the 4th dimension
*Ben slams the door open* [Ben]: ARE YOU KIDDING ME HE'S BEEN MUTED FOR LIKE 13 LINES MUTE HIM FOR LONGER *holds the smallest gun, a 2mm Kolibri pointed into the narrorater’s head. [Leo]:”BEN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT'S MY JOB, YOUR THE CO-OWNER”
[Ben]:"Sorry, let's hope that Noah doesn’t find out we broke the 4th dimensional wall.”
[Leo and Ben]: walks out of the restroom
[Noah]:"What took you so long”
[Leo]:"oh, uhhhh, we broke the 4th dimensional wall, we had to pee for a while.
[Noah]:"that makes sense”
[Ben]:"Let's stock up for water.”
[Noah]:"Can we also get a boule chocolat au crumble de fra-”
[Ben]:"No.”
sad expression from Noah
[Leo]:"Anyways, let's stock up on water for the trip to Alt + F4 the Ohioan maker.”
Ben, Leo, and Noah stock up on like gallon jugs of water while the unpaid intern makes the story
[Leo]:"Isn't the water contaminated?”
[Noah]:"No.”
[Leo]:"ok”
[Ben]:"Hurry up, our mission is to task manager the Ohioan source!, not to ramble about why the amazon rainforest is misleading for people to actually think that amazon packages are made in the amazon rainforest!”
[Noah]: drinks water
Ben, Leo, and Noah get in the"car” that is actually a jeep named Land Rover Range Rover Evoque 2.0 TD4 E-Capability 4x4 HSE Dynamic
[Ben]:"Why are we even in a Subaru or whatever?”
[Leo]:"Because it has 12,000 horsepower so It's fast i guess”
[Noah]:"My dad’s car could go faster than this!”
[Ben and Leo]:"Imagine flexing, couldn’t be me”
The setting now takes place on a trip to West virginia.
[Noah]:"It's been so long…”
[Leo]:"It's been 5 minutes”
[Ben]:"Are you sure we're going to West Virginia? This place looks like southern West Virginia.”
[Leo]:"blame it on the GPS or whatever”
[Ben]:”ok”
5PM
[Noah]:”are we there yet”
[Ben]:”no”
[Noah]:”darn”
[Leo]:”shall we go restock on stuff? We are kind of low on water”
[Noah]:”how are we on jerky?”
[Leo]:”pretty stupid”
[Noah]:”what”
[Leo]:”you said how WE are on jerky”
[Ben]:”good joke”
[Leo]:”thanks, anyways, we have like 50 packets left”
[Noah]:”wow that is a lot”
[Leo]:”I go through like 10 an hour, and we still got like 3 more hours left of the trip”
[Ben]:”should we restock?”
[Noah]:”nah It's fine we got enough”
[Ben]:”Noah do the math i eat like 2 an hour and you eat like 5 an hour, while Leo eats 10 an hour, thats 17 an hour 50 divided by 17 is- 
Then, for some reason, the font changes to Times New roman.
2.94117647059 we only have enough for 3 hours, lets say Leo eats one more an hour cause he is hungry, that would only be 2.77777777778 hours, so we should restock on jerky”
[Leo]:”Why is the font suddenly Times New Roman? Also eyes on the road Ben”
[Ben]:”I don't know, and oh right i forgot about that”
[Leo]:”your welcome Ben”
Ben, Leo, and Noah go a loves and get all the jerky they can at that same loves that is totally real and is not made of ones and zeros 
[Leo]:”There are like 5 packs of jerky here”
[Ben]:”that ain't great, we need like at least 50 packs of jerky”
[Leo]:”how about we raid their storage room”
[Ben]:”mediocre idea, but let's do it”
[Leo]:”Do you have any ideas?”
[Ben]:”no”
[Leo]:”then we have no other ideas to do”
[Noah]:”how about my idea”
[Leo]:”What's your idea Noah, sitting in a bucket till we teleport to the core of Ohio?”
[Noah]:”yes”
[Leo]:”that's totally a good idea lol”
[Noah]:”screw you”
[Leo]:”no”
Ben,Leo, and Noah go and raid the storage room I guess idk
[Ben]:”nice, jerky”
[Leo]:”finally some good food”
They get back on the road to west virginia so they can get to Ohio to destroy the goldsource engine bugs or something idk
[Ben]:”how much jerky left?”
[Noah]:”uh about 36 packs”
[Ben]:”ok we are fine”
The peoples eventually get to west virginia where they, uhh yeah i don't know i lost my script for this part of the script as well, anyways, where is that page… oh there it is, anyways, they get to west virginia and manage to somehow find a buc-ees out here, this isn’t southern area so i don't know how they found it
[Leo]:”guys look, a buc-ees!”
[Ben]:”still don't know what the heck a buc-ees is man”
[Leo]:”dont worry about it, It's fine really”
[Ben]:”Alright let’s go in, we are low on jerky”
[Leo]:”yeah, we should go in”

[Ben]:”yep, 323”
[Leo]:”how did we fit all that in our Land Rover Range Rover Evoque 2.0 TD4 E-Capability 4x4 HSE Dynamic?”
[Ben]:”there is an interdimensional space time portal in our trunk”
[Leo]:”oh ok”
[Ben]:”i like how you just accepted that as a thing”
[Leo]:”yeah”
[Ben]:”Anyways Noah, you awake?

[Ben]:”i guess he just took a nap or something”
[Leo]:”yeah”
[Noah]:”yeah i did”
[Ben]:”ok, we are in west virginia now i think, so we only have Ohio left!”
[Leo]:”Am I hearing things or do I hear Ohioans?”
[Ben]:”It's not just you, but there are no forests or buildings or whatever for them to hide behind, where are they?”
[Leo]:”im gonna feel around me and see if they are invisible”

Leo went on to be decent and make many people happy with his random Ohio script
Ben went on to become a famous roblox creator
Noah went on to be even more annoying than Leo and Ben


The narrator remembered he could sue Leo for threatening him and so he got like 5 dollars off of that because the american economy got broken by other generations and now nobody can afford to even buy a house little more feed an entire family, pay off debts from collage, pay bills for that same house that he had to take a million dollar loan out to get a one bedroom house that looks run down and is 50 miles from the nearest city, and get a beer or two
Roll credIt's or something
The end
Good night people
Have a good year
Don't let the Ohioans bite
Thank you for reading the random Ohio script but ported to my google account
Yeah i don't know anymore
Jazz music stops
[Leo]:”finally that jazz music stopped”
[Ben]:"really Leo”
A message from 2024 Ben:
I can safely say that Leo made a lot of people happy with his Ohio script.
I also have pursued a career in being a famous roblox creator.
and Noah has also progressively become more annoying.


My brother wanted to be added into the script. So I did… At the end of the script.


Everyone is talking about the script in the studio
Ben’s brother walks in
[NARRATOR]: Get out of my studio. 
[Leo]: You mean MY studio?
[NARRATOR]: …
[Ben]:”You’re too late. The script has already ended”
[Ben’s Brother]:“But I want to join your adventure!”
[Ben]:“Nope, not happening. Unless there is a sequel like I don't know,"Skibidi toilet, grimace shake, Kai Cenat, Ohio level 3 GYATT rizz (the sequel)?” No, that sequel name just makes my brain rot."
[Ben’s Brother]: WAAAAAAAAAAAAA
(Ben didn't know at the time, but a sequel was being made, not by that name but it was in fact a sequel)
Ok for real the script ends here.
Jazz music actually stops
[Leo]:”wait i thought it already stopped”
[Ben]:”shut up It's already done”
